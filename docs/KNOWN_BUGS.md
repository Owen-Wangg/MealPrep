Known Bugs: 
- Sometimes an image of a generated meal is not available. In this case, our app shows an "Image Load Error" button 
in place of an actual image.    
- If the frame is manually compressed by the user, then the contents of the app may not display properly. 
- The "generate recipe" feature will not run properly in cases where the API key has maximized its usage on the free
trial.
