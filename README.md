Team Mission: To improve eating habits for UBC students
Team Name: Meal Prep Moggers

Problem Statement:
Many UBC students struggle with meal preparation due to time constraints, limited cooking experience, and tight budgets, leading to unhealthy eating habits and increased reliance on fast food. With busy academic schedules, students often find it challenging to plan and prepare meals efficiently, which impacts both their physical health and academic performance. The root causes include a lack of accessible planning tools, difficulty balancing costs, and inexperience in the kitchen. Existing solutions are either too complex or not tailored to the unique needs of students, who require simple, affordable, and time-saving meal prep options to maintain a balanced diet and manage their time effectively.

Solution: We envision an app that addresses the challenges faced by students in preparing healthy, affordable meals by providing simple, ingredient-based meal suggestions. Users input available ingredients, and the app generates potential meals while displaying detailed nutritional information, including calories, proteins, carbs, and fats. The app also allows users to set fitness goals like weight loss or muscle gain, filtering meal suggestions to align with those objectives. A user-friendly interface ensures minimal input is required, and recipes are tailored to students' limited time and budgets. The ingredient matching algorithm ranks meals based on the number of provided ingredients and fitness goals, while the nutritional calculator provides accurate breakdowns. Error handling ensures smooth interactions, offering helpful prompts when no suitable meals are found. The app is designed to be accessible, efficient, and highly focused on the specific needs of students, helping them maintain a balanced diet amidst their busy academic schedules.

Users are initially prompted with fitness goals. These goals will dictate how calorically dense the recommended meals are and their associated macros.

Users can navigate to the Daily Digest tab upon opening the app, which showcases a breakdown of their macronutrients for the day along with a meal tracker for their upcoming meals.

If they decide that they need more ingredients, users can navigate to the Grocery List tab as a place to keep all of their desired items. 


A simple four step process where users can input their desired sources of macronutrients.

The app contains sound effects, and supports a keyboard for their personalized cook book. The game's interface layout is responsive to screen size, but uses the same interface layout for all platforms.
