* All tests are located under src in the tests directory
./src/tests

* To run the tests edit the test configuration to set
the local env variable KEY. Below we have 4 api keys
available to use, although each key caps out at 150
requests per day.

KEY=a251c92995264dbfaa72fe29e0b5ccce
KEY=c902738d454d48068e653e0b16bb9c5c
KEY=256149fb49c348a99fd5d99d1579f4f4
KEY=f4834a938888400b8b1dfbdd9f49e5ef

* We are working on "dockerizing" our project, which
includes autotests, although this is currently a 
work in progress as we trouble shoot some dependency
issues related to docker. I have spoken to a TA
about this and was told to just submit what we have
for this milestone.
